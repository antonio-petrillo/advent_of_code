* 2015 Progress [25/25]
+ [X] day 1
+ [X] day 2 
+ [X] day 3
+ [X] day 4 - very interesting
+ [X] day 5
+ [X] day 6
+ [X] day 7 - very interesting
+ [X] day 8
+ [X] day 9
+ [X] day 10
+ [X] day 11
+ [X] day 12
+ [X] day 13 - just a TSP
+ [X] day 14
+ [X] day 15 - implemented using brute force
  + Can be improved with a constraint optimization
+ [X] day 16 - improve using RTTI (a.k.a. reflection)
+ [X] day 17 - interesting
+ [X] day 18 - implemented using 2 strategies
  + bound check: check each time if the new position is inside the board
  + *NO* bound check: pad the board with 2 extra rows and 2 extra cols so I don't need to check the position is inside the board
  + In my tests I didn't find any particular difference between the twos.
+ [X] day 19 - couldn't solve on my own part 2:
  + I searched on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/3xflz8/comment/cy4etju][reddit]] for a help and I found an incredible approach 
+ [X] day 20 - first use of parapoly
+ [X] day 21 - with a little bit of math the solution can be improved quite a lot
+ [X] day 22 - Really fun to do but a lot of edge cases to consider 
+ [X] day 23 - very interesting
+ [X] day 24 - implemente a /combination iterator/, if I understand better the algorithm can become a PR for odin lang
+ [X] day 25
