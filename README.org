+ [X] day 14
+ [X] day 15 - implemented using brute force
  + Can be improved with a constraint optimization
+ [X] day 16 - improve using RTTI (a.k.a. reflection)
+ [X] day 17 - interesting
+ [X] day 18 - implemented using 2 strategies
  + bound check: check each time if the new position is inside the board
  + *NO* bound check: pad the board with 2 extra rows and 2 extra cols so I don't need to check the position is inside the board
  + In my tests I didn't find any particular difference between the twos.
